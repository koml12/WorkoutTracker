# WorkoutTracker
Android app for tracking your workouts

# Update (10/22/17)
+ Added a persistent icon for workout tracking that shows up on the app bar if there is room. If there isn't room, it goes into the overflow menu as a text item.

# To-Do (10/22/17)
+ Add a little "notes" section (no more than 1-2 lines long) to each exercise where the user can enter in a little comment about the exercise. Should be in the same dialog where the weight is entered, and it should be able to be empty. The notes should be displayed with the rest of the exercise information.
+ Add an icon for the app, and any other miscellaneous design fixes.
