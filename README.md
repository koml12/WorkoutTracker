# WorkoutTracker
Android app for tracking your workouts

# Update (9/13/17)
+ Fixed bug where trying to edit an exercise didn't work all the time, required a simple database delete and restart because the tables and structure of the database changed last time, so some entries in the database did not reflect that.
+ Fixed bug where all exercises would show when the user started the workout by passing the workout key across all activities relating to it.

# To-Do (9/13/17)
+ Users get a notification when their rest time is up.
+ Add weight logging during/after exercise has been completed (is it possible to make a list of weights for progression purposes?)
+ Make the app not ugly.
