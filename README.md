# WorkoutTracker
Android app for tracking your workouts

# Update (9/5/17)
+ Basic app completed. Users can enter exercises, with the corresponding amount of sets, reps per set, and rest time in between sets (in seconds). The app then can guide the user through the workout, keeping track of the sets completed as well as timing the rest time in between sets for the user.
+ Design is not the primary focus necessarily for the beginning stages of the app. The focus is more on the functionality of the app and how the different parts behave.

# To-Do (9/5/17)
+ Add click listeners to exercises in the workout view, that take the user to an activity where they can edit the fields of the exercise.
+ Add an option for multiple workouts (will probably have to change the database a bit to make this work).
+ Users get a notification when their rest time is up.
+ Make the app not ugly.
